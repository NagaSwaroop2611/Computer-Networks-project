Smoke Detection and Fire Prevention
Fire is the major cause of accidents claiming valuable lives and property. Smoke detectors play an important role in a fire prevention management program. Timely detection of the fireplace is vital for avoiding a serious accident. In this project, a Fire prevention and Smoke detection system is developed. It can sense smoke and the rise in temperature and alert the user by activating the siren and also send commands on the virtual terminal of the android phone through the WIFI module. Fire hazards are not uncommon. To avoid injury from fire accidents, smoke detectors are put in high-security places. The hardware used is HomeGateway, Switches, Smoke detectors, Fire sprinklers, Smoke sensor, WIFI Module, and Siren. Software used HomeGateway for mobile applications. These smoke sensors detect smoke because the fire break associated invokes an early alarm. This way, before the fire spreads to different components of the building, people can be evacuated and countermeasures can be done immediately. The detection system operates as a fire detector and smoke detector sensor. In this, we discuss the design and implementation of a smoke detection system using the HomeGateway which operates the entire system.
A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Commercial, Industrial, and mass residential devices issue a signal to a fire alarm system, while household detectors, known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself.
A smoke detector's purpose is a simple one, to give you ample notification in case of a fire in your house. Without a smoke detector, by the time you realize that there is a fire, your house could be so badly engulfed that you cannot find a safe exit or the smoke can be so overwhelming that you suffocate trying to get out. The National Fire Protection Association reports that while 75 percent of homes have at least one working smoke alarm, between 2003 and 2006, 66 percent of fire deaths happened in homes with no working smoke alarm. 
Home fire detection is a matter of great concern, and thus many efforts are devoted in most developed countries to the design of automatic detection systems. A fire prevention system should reliably and in a timely way notify building occupants about the presence of fire indicators, such as smoke or high temperatures. A fire detector is usually implemented as a smoke sensor due to its early fire detection capability, fast response time, and relatively low cost. Other options for fire detection are based on gas sensors or temperature sensors fire detectors that use a single sensor, generally a smoke sensor, and present high false-siren rates due to temperature changes.
